Brexit was about ordinary people rising up to defeat the establishment and we've now seen the same happen in the US.,1,
2016 is the year of political revolution: Brexit in the UK and @realDonaldTrump in the US.,1,
We now have a US President who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values.,1,
"Today, the establishment is in deep shock. Even more so than after Brexit.",1,
Looks like 2016 is going to be the year of two big political revolutions @realDonaldTrump. Would be bigger than Brexit!,1,
Is this Brexit day in the US? I hope so.,1,
The referendum result must be respected. Leave means Leave: out of the single market. #Brexit,1,
My fear is we now get half Brexit. Establishment will try and lock us inside single market. Would be a total betrayal!,1,
"As we saw with Brexit, pollsters cannot measure non-voters who want change coming into the electoral process. ",1,
@realDonaldTrump's voters are a bit like Brexit voters; they have enthusiasm &amp; passion. Trump has momentum and I think he will win.,1,
Brexit has given inspiration across the world to those who believe in nation state democracy and border controls.,1,
If the establishment think they can stitch-up Brexit then they better be ready for the huge electoral consequences.,1,
The British people went out there and voted to take back control of their country! #Brexit,1,
"Brexit must mean end to free movement, out of single market &amp; taking back our territorial waters. Anything less would be betrayal.",1,
Starting to detect a lot of frustration out there from the 17 million who voted Leave. Government need to get on with it and deliver Brexit.,1,
The appointment of @DavidDavisMP &amp; @LiamFoxMP to Brexit and International Trade roles are inspired choices. I feel more optimistic now.,1,
"A u-turn on curbing migration would be a betrayal of the Brexit vote. Target should be 30,000-50,000 net per year. ",1,
"No, thank you @Arron_banks and @LeaveEUOfficial - without you we could not have done this. #Brexit ",1,
61% in Oldham have backed #Brexit. Thrilled.,1,
"It's time to get our borders back, our democracy back and our country back. #Brexit ",1,
"Where is Lord Rose, head of the In campaign? He's disappeared after admitting Brexit means higher wages.",1,
We used to protest against the establishment. Now the establishment protests against us. We must be doing something right. #Brexit,1,
Ignore Mr. Osborne's fantasy budget. Post-Brexit he won't be the Chancellor for very long.,1,
My vision for Britain is upbeat and optimistic. Let's Leave EU and think globally. #Brexit,1,
"I want what's best for Britain: controlling our own borders, making our own laws, running our own country. #Brexit ",1,
I've put my money where my mouth is #Brexit,1,
Just been down the bookies. We're gonna win this! #Brexit,1,
"I now firmly believe that we are going to win this referendum, Leave EU and get our country back. #Brexit ",1,
Pleased that Boris Johnson & Michael Gove now support same policy I've advocated for years #Brexit,1,
"Looking forward to campaigning across the country on the Brexit Bus. Together, we will get our country back! ",1,
Just launched UKIP's national tour on the open top #Brexit bus. It's time to liven up the #EUref campaign!,1,
"If you want to Leave the European Union then help build the momentum today. Vote #Brexit, vote UKIP. ",1,
I think we will vote for #Brexit because we'll be voting to put our own national security first,1,
Isis camps targeting attacks in Europe. Let's take back control of our borders for sake of national security #Brexit http://dailym.ai/1UN6A9C,1,
100 days to go - Let's make June 23rd our Independence Day! #Brexit,1,
Appalled that the Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce has been suspended for backing Brexit.,1,
Pro-EU establishment reduced to issuing meaningless threats. The public aren't buying it. Bodes well for #Brexit.,1,
I welcome @themichaelcaine's support for #Brexit. Let's blow the bloody doors off!,1,
"No double referendum. #Leave means outside of the EU with strong border controls, trade &amp; co-operation. #Brexit",1,
Toyota latest to confirm will stay post-#Brexit. Bright future ahead. Ignore scaremongering from @fmwales &amp; Remain.,1,
I welcome the @Vote_leave campaign. Making the business argument for leaving the EU is important if we are to win the referendum. #Brexit,1,
Francois Hollande is perfectly clear: either the UK must back further EU integration or we must leave. #Brexit,2,
We have a bright star on the horizon: the UK's referendum on EU membership. #Brexit,1,
#Brexit now looks more likely than ever before. I hope it marks the beginning of the end of the EU project.,1,

"The UK government's lack of a credible plan for Brexit in their white paper, is an act wilful economic vandalism. #Brexit #Article50",0,
"No plan, no detail and a wilful ignorance of the damage to trade and jobs. This is how a hard Tory #Brexit will happen. ",0,
"Another capitulation from Labour. No fight, no interest in defending ordinary people, no clue. #brexit ",0,
Useless performance by May in response to questions from @AngusRobertson Tory #brexit plan appears now to be making stuff up &amp; daft slogans.,0,
Now the #brexit Tories want cities to end European Capital of Culture bids. What a petty minded idea. We must stop this UK isolationism,0,
By confirming the UK Govt will use perogative powers & by-pass Parliament for a damaging #brexit tells us they still don't have a plan.,0,

This is quite something. The Tories are leading us blindly off a hard Brexit cliff. Scotland deserves a choice. #scotref,0,
I said very clearly that's not what I intended. I want informed choice when we have clarity on Brexit - based on PM's own timetable.,0,
Scotland deserves an informed choice on our future once the terms of Brexit are known. Read my speech here. #scotref,0,

Rough translation - Ruth Davidson wants Brexit UK Tory government to have free hand to take Scotland in whatever bad direction it chooses.,1,
For those asking what I mean by 'soft Brexit' read @scotgov paper on single market membership and expanded powers - http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00512073.pdf,2,
